The bundles in this directory are copies of those in ../com.springsource.org.hibernate
They exist only to disambiguate bundle symbolic names between hibernate 3.x and 4.x
given that Spring Framework 3.1 needs to compile against both of them, and
ivy/spring-build doesn't allow two identical symbolic names to co-exist.
