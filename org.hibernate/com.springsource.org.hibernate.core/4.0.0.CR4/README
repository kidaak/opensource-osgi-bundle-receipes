The contents of this bundle are identical to ../../com.springsource.org.hibernate/4.0.0.CR4.
This bundle exists only to disambiguate bundle symbolic names between hibernate 3.x and 4.x
given that Spring Framework 3.1 needs to compile against both of them, and ivy/spring-build
doesn't allow two identical symbolic names to co-exist.
