Customizing UrlDefinitionsFactory

  The
  {{{../../config-reference.html#UrlDefinitionsFactory configuration}<<<UrlDefinitionsFactory>>>}}
  is the default implementation of
  {{{../../apidocs/org/apache/tiles/definition/DefinitionsFactory.html}<<<DefinitionsFactory>>>}}.

* Definitions reader

  The
  {{{../../config-reference.html#org.apache.tiles.definition.DefinitionsReader}<<<DefinitionsReader>>>}}
  interfaces reads a source (usually an URL) to return a map of raw (i.e. with
  their inheritance <<not resolved>>) definitions. The default implementation,
  {{{../../apidocs/org/apache/tiles/definition/digester/DigesterDefinitionsReader.html}<<<DigesterDefinitionsReader>>>}}
  reads from usual Tiles XML definition files using Jakarta Commons Digester.
  
  If you need to read definitions from other kind of sources, this is the item
  to configure.

* Locale resolver

  The
  {{{../../config-reference.html#org.apache.tiles.locale.LocaleResolver}<<<LocaleResolver>>>}}
  interface resolves the current locale requested by the user. The default
  implementation,
  {{{../../apidocs/org/apache/tiles/locale/impl/DefaultLocaleResolver.html}<<<DefaultLocaleResolver>>>}}
  takes the current locale from a session-scoped Locale object under the
  <<<org.apache.tiles.LOCALE>>> key. If it is not found, the default locale of
  the request will be taken.

  If you want to read the current locale in other ways, this is the item to
  configure.
