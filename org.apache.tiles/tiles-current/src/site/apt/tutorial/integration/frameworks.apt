         Integration with other Frameworks
         -----------

Integration with other web Frameworks

  Tiles can be integrated with other web frameworks. Usually this kind of
  integration is made through extensions/plugins to Tiles.
  
  * {{{http://struts.apache.org/1.x/index.html}Struts 1}}: Currently under
  development. A Struts 1 plugin is available in the SVN trunk, that presumably
  will be released along with Struts 1.4.
  
  * {{{http://struts.apache.org/2.x/index.html}Struts 2}}: A Struts 1 plugin is
  provided, though it needs to be updated to the latest released version of
  Tiles.
  
  * {{{http://shale.apache.org/shale-tiles/index.html}Shale}}: An integration
  layer is provided, but it needs to be updated to the latest released version
  of Tiles.
