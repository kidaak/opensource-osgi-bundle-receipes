         Getting started
         -----------

Requirements

  To use Tiles in your application you need:
  
  * a Java Runtime Environment following the <<Java SE 5.0>> specifications;

  * a servlet container that supports <<Servlet 2.4>> (or above) and <<JSP
  2.0>> (or above).

Installation

  To install Tiles in your web application:
  
  * {{{../download.html}download}} a distribution of Tiles;

  * if you downloaded the binary distribution, unpack it;

  * copy the <<<tiles-core-VERSION.jar>>>, <<<tiles-api-VERSION.jar>>>,
  <<<tiles-servlet-VERSION.jar>>> and <<<tiles-jsp-VERSION.jar>>> files
  in the <<<WEB-INF/lib>>> directory of your web application. It is
  <<not reccomended>> to put them in a location where they are shared
  across the container;

  * copy the Tiles dependencies JARs:
  
    ** {{{http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/beanutils/}Jakarta Commons BeanUtils}}
    1.7.0 or above;
    
    ** {{{http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/digester/}Jakarta Commons Digester}}
    1.8 or above;
    
    ** {{{http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/logging/}Jakarta Commons Logging}}
    (at least API) 1.1 or above.
  
  These dependencies are present in the <<<lib>>> directory of the binary
  distribution;

  * if you need JSP support, copy the <<<tiles-jsp-VERSION.jar>>> in the
  <<<WEB-INF/lib>>> directory of your web application;

  * if you need to load Tiles definition files using wildcards, copy the 
  <<<spring-web-VERSION.jar>>>, <<<spring-core-VERSION.jar>>>,
  <<<spring-context-VERSION.jar>>>, <<<spring-beans-VERSION.jar>>>,
  <<<aopalliance-VERSION.jar>>> files under the <<<WEB-INF/lib>>> directory;

  * if you need to load Tiles definition files using wildcards under a
  <<portlet environment>>, copy the <<<spring-webmvc-portlet-VERSION.jar>>>,
  <<<spring-core-VERSION.jar>>>, <<<spring-context-VERSION.jar>>>,
  <<<spring-beans-VERSION.jar>>>, <<<aopalliance-VERSION.jar>>> files under the
  <<<WEB-INF/lib>>> directory;

  * if you need to use EL in XML definition files under a Servlet 2.4/JSP 2.0
  environment, copy <<<el-api-VERSION.jar>>> and <<<jasper-el-VERSION.jar>>>
  files under the <<<WEB-INF/lib>>> directory.

Usage

  If you are using Tiles for the first time, read the
  {{{tutorial/index.html}Tutorial}}.

  If you are migrating from Struts-Tiles, see the
  {{{migration/index.html}Migration guide}}.

Examples

  To see Tiles in action, there are two examples:
  
  * The Tiles test web application, included in <<<examples>>> directory of the
  binary distribution ({{{download.html}download it}}).
  
  * The Tiles showcase, that shows Tiles features and integration with other
  technologies and frameworks (currently only Struts 1).
  
  Currently it is still under development, and you can access it through its
  subversion repository:
